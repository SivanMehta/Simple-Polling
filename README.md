# Simple Polling

This is a simple Node.js app used to easily make polls. Right now it works purely through an URL API and text responses. Hopefully I can make it work like a proper app should.

## Future Tasks

*Provided I ever get here*

1. Move URL interface to buttons
2. Use some CSS framework to make polling more easy on the eyes
3. Prevent duplicate poll usage
4. Ability to delete polls
5. Authentication/Authorization (stretch until end of semester when I know how to do this)
