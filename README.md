# Simple Polling

This is a simple Node.js app used to easily make polls. Hopefully I can make it work like a proper app should.

## Usage

#### Example Polls
```
/populate_example
```
You can create two example polls, `election` and `ideal vacation` by visiting this URL.

## Future Tasks

*Provided I ever get here*

1. Prevent duplicate poll usage
2. Ability to delete polls
3. Authentication/Authorization (stretch until end of semester when I know how to do this) (or you can very sketchily store the password in plaintext in the poll object)
4. Handling people using forced browsing (entering via URL) and potentially voting on polls that don't exist.
